High-budget films show some outliers with high multipliers and longer runtimes, suggesting blockbuster potential for epic-scale movies. Low-budget films also have outliers with high multipliers, indicating potential sleeper hits. Both high and low-budget categories show a wide scatter, implying that runtime alone is not a strong predictor of financial success. Overall, while there are high-performing movies at various lengths, the majority of films from both budget categories tend to have moderate runtimes and multipliers.
